			<h3>Beagle</h3>
			
			<img src="images/beagle.jpg"
			type="image/jpg">
			<p>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative  training techniques.

Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States. But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.

DogTime recommends this carrier for traveling with your small Beagle. You should also pick up this dog water bottle for any outdoor adventures you have with your pup!. Please do remember to <a class="btn" href="happy paws part 2/adopt.html">adopt!</a>

	<h3>Bulldog</h3>
	
	<img src="images/bulldog.jpg">
	<p>The Bulldog was originally used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids.

Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to <a href="happy paws part 2/adopt.html"> adopt!</a> Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.

A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is just this dog breed‘s speed. Bulldogs can adapt well to apartment life and even make great companions for novice pet parents. They’re affectionate with all members of the family and are fairly low-maintenance pups. Just make sure to keep them out of extreme weather, and also give them enough exercise, as weight gain is a risk with these dogs who are happy to spend most of the day on the couch.

Did you know they make dog food specifically for Bulldogs?

	<h3>German Shepherd</h3>
	
	<img src="images/german shepherd.jpg">
	<p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds — for good reasons. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile.

The breed also goes by the name Alsatian. Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to <a href="happy paws part 2/adopt.html"> adopt!</a> Don’t shop if this is the breed for you.


GSDs excel at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and — last but not least — faithful companion.</p>

	<h3>Golden retriever</h3>
	
	<img src="images/Golden retriever.jpg">
	<p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.

Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.

These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and smart companion, consider adopting one of these pups into your pack.

DogTime recommends this dog bed to give a good night’s sleep to your medium-sized Golden. You should also pick up this dog de-shedder for your high shedding pup!

	<h3>Poodle</h3>
	
	<img src="images/poodle.jpg">
	<p>Elegant. Proud. Clever. The Poodle is an impressive dog, as the many best-in-show winners from this dog breed can attest. But behind the blue ribbons, impressive hairdos, and regal attitude, you’ll find an affectionate family dog with an ancient history and many talents.

Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to <a href="happy paws part 2/adopt.html">adopt!</a> Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.

Poodles are regarded as one of the most intelligent breeds in the world. They’re highly trainable and well suited for just about any task you put them to — and you will want to give them tasks to do. Bored Poodles can get destructive if they aren’t physically and mentally stimulated. But active owners who can meet their dog’s needs will find a loving, smart, trainable, and loyal family companion.</p>
